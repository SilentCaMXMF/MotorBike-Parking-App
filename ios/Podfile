  # FIREBASE PODS - COMMENTED OUT FOR API MIGRATION
  # These Firebase pods are preserved for potential scaling back to Firebase if
  # the local Raspberry Pi backend reaches capacity limits.
  # 
  # Firebase packages have been commented out in pubspec.yaml, so these pods
  # will not be included when running 'pod install'. This section documents
  # what Firebase pods were previously used.
  #
  # To re-enable Firebase:
  # 1. Uncomment Firebase packages in pubspec.yaml
  # 2. Run 'flutter pub get'
  # 3. Run 'pod install' in the ios directory
  # 4. Uncomment Firebase initialization in lib/main.dart
  # 5. Rebuild the iOS app
  #
  # Previously used Firebase pods (automatically included via Flutter plugins):
  # - Firebase/Core (from firebase_core package)
  # - Firebase/Auth (from firebase_auth package)
  # - Firebase/Firestore (from cloud_firestore package)
  # - Firebase/Storage (from firebase_storage package)
  # ============================================================================
  # END FIREBASE PODS
